  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">How cultures and ideologies are born: Rising against the ancestral authority and the need for collaboration</h1>
  <p style="margin-top: 4px">Written on 16th June 2023 between 2:14 AM - 3:08 AM</p>
  <p>Every parent wants their children to be a carbon copy of themselves. Nearly all parents disagree with this solid truth which they generally choose to hide behind the "for my child's good" mask. When we talk about what's good and what's bad we always think of "good" according to our own ideology and this is no different for parents. They keep repeating the same "for their good" phrase even when they are aware that their actions are harming their child.</p>
  <p>Let's give a few examples of this dilemma. Let's say there exists a family of 3 religious members. What happens when their child converts to another religion or becomes an atheist? In many examples, we can see religious parents in question forcing their children and torturing them psychologically and sometimes physically for years which almost never achieves "the good for my child" according to their ideology and just ends up harming the person further for no reason.</p>
  <p>We can give similar examples about contradicting political ideologies, LGBTQ+ people living in dangerous households, and so on.</p>
  <p>But how come ideologies and movements can be born with this extreme amount of brainwashing done by ancestors? I think the answer is collaboration and a community of people rising against the ancestral authority. Here's a comment I found on Reddit a few weeks ago:</p>
  <div class="box"><p>"I think having some LGBTQ representation in media is good for teenagers. When I was a teen I liked boys and always thought there was something wrong with me and no one else felt like that. That changed the day I saw "Desert Hearts" which had a lesbian couple in it. That day was the day I realized I was not alone and we existed"</p></div>
  <p>Of course, this is an example regarding sexuality and not an ideology or something you can change later in your life but I think it applies to ideologies too since those also tend to pop up on their own when they first get created. People need someone to share their thoughts to turn these "just random" thoughts into persistent, serious ideas. The human brain can't consider an idea useful if no one agrees with it and ideas are not simple enough to develop in a single person's brain. That's why the need for collaboration exists while developing a movement or an ideology.</p>
  <p>Another reason why collaboration is needed for developing ideas and breaking down walls is that people tend to retreat into their shells when no one thinks the same as them and everyone forces them to think the same as themselves. They just sit there with their own thoughts and never share them with anyone, fearing the consequences. I believe many ideas were never spoken of and were buried together with their owner.</p>
  <p>Well, this sounded a lot better in my mind. Though I think it's still worth publishing</p>
